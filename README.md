# BAWiM- DVWA
BAWiM course project created by Szymon Bobrowski& Mateusz Åšwider.
# About
During this classes we're gonna focus on the safety of our session, in particular, how to secure our cookies from various attacks. We will also try to improve our practical skills, utilizing the __'Damn Vulnerable Web Application' (DVWA)__. Should you have any problem, don't hesitate to ask or just go to sources- most likely you can find a solution there.
# Step by step installation
## On Windows
We recommend running the app with xampp:
* download and install xampp (Apache + Mysql + PHP): https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
* download and unzip DVWA: http://dvwa.co.uk/
* open xampp -> explorer -> htdocs and delete all files, create new folder named dvwa, then move there all downloaded DVWA files
* go to config folder (one of those, that have been moved) and change the name of the main config file `config.inc.php.dist` -> `config.inc.php`
* modify the config file with notepad or other similar tool and change the default passowrd to blank, like that: `$_DVWA['db_password']='';`
* run the Apache and Mysql servers
* run the web browser- we highly recommend __Firefox__, since some features don't work on other browsers, e.g. chrome
* try to sign in into admin account- the default credentials should be `admin:password`
* at the bottom of the page, __Setup / Reset DB__ tab on the left, try to __Create / Reset Database__
* if you didn't receive any error message, you can skip all the next steps and go to the exercises
* if so, stop Apache and Mysql servers
* go to Mysql -> config -> my.ini
* add the following line `skip-grant-tables` right under `[mysqld]`, it should look like that:
```
(...)
# The MySQL server
default-character-set=utf8mb4
[mysqld]
skip-grant-tables
port=3306
(...)
```
* run Apache and Mysql servers again and repeat previous steps, now you should be able to setup your database and start exercises.

## On Linux
* `sudo apt-get update`
* `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`- it will take a few minutes.
* `sudo apt install apache2` 
* `sudo apt-get install git` 
* `sudo apt install mysql-server` 
* `sudo apt install php` 
* `sudo apt install php-mysql`
* `cd /var/www/html`
* `sudo git clone https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/DVWA`
* `sudo chmod -R 777 DVWA`
* `sudo mv DVWA dvwa`
* Now you need to edit the configuration file, e.g. `sudo nano DVWA/config/config.inc.php.dist`, replace the password value with blank: `$_DVWA['db_password']='';` and username with _root_: `$_DVWA['db_user']='root';`. Save the file as __config.inc.php__
* `sudo service mysql start`
* `sudo mysql -u root -p` and leave the password field blank
* inside mysql shell `create user 'root'@'127.0.0.1' identified by '';`
* also inside mysql shell `grant all privileges on dvwa.* to 'root'@'127.0.0.1';`, then `\q` to exit
* `cd /etc/php/<version_named_directory>/apache2`
* configure `php.ini`, e.g. `sudo nano php.ini`
* search for _allow_url_ (inside nano- ctrl+w), both _allow_url_include_ and _allow_url_fopen_ values should be set to _On_
* `sudo service apache2 start`
* run the web browser- we highly recommend __Firefox__ and go to `http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/setup.php`
* at the bottom of the page, __Setup / Reset DB__ tab on the left, try to __Create / Reset Database__
* you should be redirected to `http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/login.php`. Sign in, default credentials are `admin:password`
* now you should be able to start the exercises


# Exercises
_To avoid any issues, we suggest you to reset your database and clean all cookies after each of the exercises_
## 1. UPEL quiz
Go to the UPEL website and take the short quiz.
## 2. Weak Session IDs
In this exercise we're gonna consider some bad practices regarding cookies generation, using DVWA. In the __DVWA Security__ tab, you can change the security level of your cookies generator. Then, in the __Weak Session IDs__ tab, you can generate new cookies. Your task is to make out how the cookies are created on the following levels: low, medium, high. In case you need some help- go to the _Viev source_- it's written explicitely in the code. As a report, hand a screenshot of a few cracked cookies hashes on the high level. For cracking, you can use the following site: https://crackstation.net/ (it's possible to crack several hashes at once).  
Now it's clear, that such ways od cookies generation are easy to guess and vulnerable to brute force attacks.
## 3. Cross site scripting (stored)
At first, change the security level- the higher you choose, the better the protection is. Now, try to inject a piece of javascript code, that would send the visitor cookies at the given address. If you want to, you can use burp suite or some python script (like http.server <port number>), however it's much easier and less complicated to use some external site, e.g. https://webhook.site/. As a report, pass a snapshot of captured cookies. If you want to, you can try to solve the problem on several security levels.  
Hint: The default '_Message/Name_' field length is too small- most likely it won't be enough, so just change it in the source code for, let's say, _300_
## 4. Last but not least- Session hijacking
No matter what the way of capturing somebody's cookies was- now we can make an advatage of it. While logged in on one browser tab, open another one and try to sign in with no credentials given. You can use a cookie manager, like: https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/cookie-editor/ (for Firefox). The last step is to modify the cookies. Then you need to change your url address source path (remove _/login.php_), so it would look the following way: _<your_ip_address>/<your_dvwa_folder_name>/_. That's it- you should be logged in into hacked user account. As a report, just send a screenshot of a page with admin account signed in.
